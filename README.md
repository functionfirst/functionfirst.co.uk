Simple portfolio site to showcase some of my previous work, though most of it is a couple of years old now.

As a Senior Front-end Developer in the R&D team at [Visualsoft](https://www.visualsoft.co.uk),
most of my work is now concentrated on improving our platform for all our clients. With a focus on performance, and modern technologies such as AMP and Vue.js.
